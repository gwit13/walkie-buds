# walkie-buds
Microphone-sharing app for wireless earbuds

Useful for loud environments while still being relatively close to each other, Walkie-buds will take the right channel microphone input (worn by Person A) and route that audio to the left earbud (Person B). Likewise, vice versa - Left channel mic will be routed to the right earbud. Useful for bike rides, crowded spaces, running, etc.
